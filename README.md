<p>I hope that in class tonight we discuss more about the app or blog we should work toward developing in this class. It could make a difference in the direction I go. I always think of a blog as a type of diary. I could come up with material for a travel blog or site, or for a photo site, or for selling myself for getting a job.</p>

<p>One plan I have had is to convert a tech writing document into a web page. This would require altering of the content, as documents are wordier than web content, but I can use some of the text for an example. Right now, this would be easier in HTML, as I am more familiar with that than Markdown. I would also normally do this in a text editor first.</p>

# Guide to Photographing Waterfalls  

## Introduction  

<p> One of the most popular photographic subjects is moving water. People are naturally drawn to images of silky water, whether those pictures are taken at the beach or cascading over a cliff. </p>
<p> Youâ€™ve probably stood in front of a waterfall, pulled out your camera, and snapped what you thought would be wonderful pictures. When you got home, you discovered they lacked that silky angel hair you were expecting. How come? How do you make your pictures get that cotton candy look? </p>
<p> That cotton candy look is achieved by taking a long exposure shot of the water itself. The effect is enhanced by contrasting the water against a sharp background. However, if you just randomly set your camera for a long exposure your picture quality will likely be poor. If you are hand-holding the camera the photo will be blurry. Without changing other camera settings your picture will be overexposed. But which changes do you make? And why? If you know just a little bit about how your camera makes an image, you can learn how to use that knowledge to take beautiful pictures of moving water. </p>
<p> In this guide, you will learn about how correct exposure is achieved through the Exposure Triangle. You will then learn how to apply that knowledge in the field. At the end, you will know how to take your own beautiful shots of waterfalls.</p>

<p> This goes on, and there are lots of images. Again, I recognize this text isn't exactly what one would do for a website, but it's something to work with. Let me know if I am on the right track, or should look at goin in a different direction.</p>
