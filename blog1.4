<h2>About</h2>
<h3>My Life in 754 Words</h3>
<p>I was born on a snowy morning in January, 6.18 AM to be exact. As I was ass down in the womb –explaining my lifelong large posterior – I was yanked out via c-section. The doctors told tale of how I was sound asleep at the time and sucking on my right forefinger. Yes, even at birth I hated mornings. Yes, I truly am a natural born night person.</p>
<p>My birth was followed by the usual childhood calamities: A mild electrocution, a couple of concussions, car crashes and an assortment of cuts and stitches. I was always one of the popular ones when it came to comparing scars in the schoolyard. I just don’t understand what these over-coddled kids whose parents won’t even let them play outside for fear of injury compare instead. Maybe it’s how long they were sick for with the diseases they needn’t have gotten at all if Mommy and Daddy hadn’t listened to Jenny McCarthy about the evils of vaccines or suffered under the bizarre delusion that natural immunity from a disease is superior to that acquired from a vaccine. But I digress…</P
<p>High school started out rough. On one of the first days of my freshman year I was sent home for dressing inappropriately. I was wearing black corduroy pants with a matching black corduroy vest. I looked good. I was told I looked so good that the boys couldn’t concentrate on anything other than my cleavage. But school was just school. I recall the only memorable event at school itself was watching a group of boys run across a tabletop and the whole table collapsing underneath one of them. Well, there was the infamous Christmas caroling episode. Years afterward I can remember going to bars with my best friend Erin and people coming up to ask her “Hey! Aren’t you the girl who puked in the basement of Prep?”</p>
<p>It was outside of school that the real living took place. Myself and my best friend Erin ran into our art teacher at the Comet Tavern one night during our freshman year. We were drinking beers. He went white as a sheet.   It wasn’t but a few months later that another teacher – a priest, no less – recounted the episode to our entire class sans names. Everybody turned and looked at us. I wonder how they would have reacted had they witnessed the time when I accidentally spilled a bottle of poppers on a table in the restaurant at Jay Jacobs followed by my companion’s cigarette ember dropping on it. The resulting conflagration could be seen throughout the whole second level, especially since it was reflected in the mirrored wall. My other extracurricular accomplishments included climbing the rooftops of downtown buildings and spending a good couple of years as the undisputed queen of Seattle’s most notorious underage all night gay disco, The Monastery.  I hear all these tales of how adolescence is a time of turmoil and misery. Not for me.</p>
<p>After a suitable break I moved onto USC. Well, not actually onto the campus. I had no intention of ever living in that neighborhood. Instead I moved into an apartment just above the Sunset Strip. The building was the same that one Angelyne of pink Corvette and giant billboard fame resided in. The first time I saw her I thought she was a hooker. Over time I became well acquainted with her and her bad boob job as well as her buddy Nina Hagen. As I have already pushed the word limit I’ll skip the details of the LA years. I will tell you that all those people who hate LA just don’t know how to live.</p>
<p>I moved to Australia in the early 90s. From the window seat of the Dash 8 from Sydney to Canberra I experienced watching the plane get hit by lightning. When one has had almost no sleep and is half hungover from an entertaining evening in Auckland one is not nearly as upset at this sight as one who is wide awake and completely sober when hearing the captain state at thirty eight thousand feet, “Ladies and gentlemen there’s a problem with tonight’s flight to Lima.” Here’s a fun fact about Australia’s parliament: the MPs have their own bar. For them. And guests. It’s quite nice. Our Congress has no such thing.<p>
<p>I’m sure I could go on but I wouldn’t want to bore you. I will say this: I’m the only person I know who has been attacked by a plague of locusts.</p>
